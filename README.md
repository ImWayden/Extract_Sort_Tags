# Extract_Sort_Tags
Just some script to extract automatically the tags contained in .lsx files and to sort them.


# To Do
Make a Parent script

Modify and Optimize Ultra sort (probably could make a 2temps files both being sorted copies of the 2 files being compared)

adding a script to name then concact the sorted file :  [main attributs]\_[nb of attributs per tags]\_[nb of similarities]
